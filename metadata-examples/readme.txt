This is a sample Python script that demonstrates how to pull RF Metadata using the RF API.  The script formats the output as indented text that has a similar look when using Explore.  But, this script could easily be modified to support other output formats.

Requirements:
  1.  Must have a copy RFAPI.py in your current directory.  In root level of the https://github.com/recordedfuture/api repository.
  2.  Valid RF API token.  Add the token to the script at the following line of code.

     # Token and Metadata Query
     TOKEN="<Your Token Here>" 

Usage:  python ./Print_RF_Metadata.py
